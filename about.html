        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! My name is Simon and I'm looking forward to diving deeper into html & css! I picked the Tardigrade for this assignment because I think it's very cool that
            they can survive in so many extreme enviroments. I believe we will learn how they are able to "suspend" their cells aging for a period of time. Who knows, 
            it might even be the ticket to cryosleep. To put it another way, Tardigrades are freaking metal!
        </p>

        <h2>About This Site</h2>
        <p>This site was made as a mid term project of CS50 at SRJC during the '21 Spring semester. I did my best to only use images that have a creative commons liscense,
            and worked to provide attribution wherever possible. I used mostly wikimedia to find resources, as well as the wayback machine!
        </p>
